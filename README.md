# Temperature-Control-State-Machine
This Python program simulates a temperature control system using a finite state machine. It dynamically switches between states to manage a heater and cooler based on user-input temperatures. The system adjusts cooler and heater modes (e.g., low/high) and reacts to temperature thresholds, ensuring efficient temperature regulation.
